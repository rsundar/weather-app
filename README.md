# Weather App

> The purpose of this project is to hone our skills in API access with asynchronous functions in javascript. In order to do this I have built a simple web application which
  allows the user to appraise themselves of the weather conditions in a city of their choice. OpenWeatherMap API was used for the weather data for this project.
